valuenetwork
=====================

A prototype of Value Network Accounting, being developed in collaboration with http://www.sensorica.co/ , a pioneering value network.

We mean Accounting in a large sense.  We are developing something analogous to an ERP system for value networks.  Might call it NRP for Network Resource Planning.

Background on Value Networks: http://www.sensorica.co/value-networks

The prototype used the https://github.com/pinax/pinax-project-account starter project, built on the Django framework.

See /docs/install.txt for developer installation instructions. (More doc to come.)

The valueaccounting app could be split out and used in other Django projects.
